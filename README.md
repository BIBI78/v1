# The Main Idea

This project is based on a fictious art gallery in Vienna. It allows artists to sign up then post and sell their artwork.
Users sign up create a profile and post their work. I noticed on most gallery websites the gallery doesnt really offer more information on the artists/users previous works or backgrounds .They kind of act like a buffer between artists and art buyer, maybe that is done on prupose, but I wanted to update that model and bring it slighlty into 2023.

As a **USER** I can **change or delete my profile picture**

As a **USER** I can **write a short bio** so that **so that other users can read about me**

As a **USER** I can **like other users posts** so that **I encourage others**

As a **USER** I can **edit posts** so that **I can update them and change them if I feel like it**

### Project Goal

Demonstrate CRUD functionailty, database manipulation and an understanding of Django frameworks + HTLM , CSS, JavaScript and Python.

### Design Inception

Initially the project was going to be a runner-instragram like app. So I started the main design ideas with that in mind. The main intresest in a running ap would be to track your speed and distance and performance and so to do what I wanted would require more knowledge than I currently possess and the design was simply ugly. So in the end I opted for something eqaully close to my hear , art , more specifially painting and Vienna.

The idea which at the heart was supposed to be instagram in spirit is actually quite simple and based on modern art gallery sites found in New York city.

The crud fucntionality came pretty simply after I had settled on an idea.
![Runner app example](static/images/runner1.png/)
When I ditched the "Runner app " idea and settled on the art gallery idea everything clicked and I could see the design in my head exactly behinds the scenes.

## Testing

All testing has been done manually.
Testing as much as possible is reflected in the user stories.
Testing has been done constantly throughout all the manifestations of this project.

This is more or less how testing was done:

- Does the code do what I want it to do?
- Are there any bugs ?
- Remove bugs
- Check user stories
- Test for CRUD functionality
- Make code "Pretty"
- Run through validator

### Bugs during development

- There were not so many bugs but the bugs I did have were mostly sytanctial.

- The biggest bug happend to be syntactical. I had used the inccorect boostrap wording and it made viewing another users profile diffiuclt when already logged in. The already logged in user would upon viewing another users profile be logged in as that user but none of the actual functions came along with it.

### Unfixed Bugs

#### Lighthouse score / testing

- The image sizes are bringing down my scores dramatically but since images are uploaded by users, this is beyond my control for now but in a future implementation, I plan on restricting file sizes to 24mb.
  ![Lighthouse score 1](static/images/lighthouse_score_1.png)
  ![Lighthouse score 2](static/images/lighthouse_score_2.png)
  ![Lighthouse score 3](static/images/lighthouse_score_3.png)

- I could not figure out how to rewrite this in way that passes.
  ![Validator testing](static/images/linter_bug.png)

- In an earlier manifestation of the app I tried to include and infinite scroll but I got some strange "glitch" effect where there was anything more to load.

- With the google WAVE tool there are errors about my color choices, but have chosen to keep my choices for asestetic reasons.

#### WAVE

- WAVE contrast errors - I am aware WAVE is highlighting my font colour choice as problematic, but I have made an aesthetic decision to keep it this palette.

## Deployment

The site was deployed to Heroku using these steps:

- First a requirements.txt file is needed to migrate the database before deployment
- I used the usual config vars, Secret key value ,Port value, DATABASE_URL value, these values were stored env.py file
- Set Heroku as an allowed host.
- Create GitHub procfile
- Then after final push , on the Heroku site youu just deploy

## Security notes

- In the commits there is a secret key displayed but I have changed the actual secret key in my proper env file.
